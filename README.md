# Rust implementation for Advent of Code 2018

No better way to learn a new programming language than trying to solve some puzzles.
I'm using the 2018 edition of Advent of Code to practice writing some Rust code.
The solutions are probably not always done "The Rust Way", so feedback is always welcome.
